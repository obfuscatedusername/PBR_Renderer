# PBR_Renderer
C++ / OpenGL | An exploration of Physically Based Rendering

This project is written in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering, I decided to use ImGui to create a simple UI for the user.

Currently it has lighting that utilises a number of techniques to create the physically realistic materials, textures were obtained
from pbrtexture.com. 

The next stage is to utilise HDR maps to create more realistic lighting and reflections, and tidy up the code a little.
